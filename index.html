    <p>
        You might be wondering why I think bunnies are so cute. I've listed some hard facts below proving that bunnies are, in fact, very cute.
        <ol>
            <li> They have little noses that do little nose wiggles</li>
            <li>Their ears can stick straight up or flop down. So adorable.</li>
            <li>They don't walk, they <em> hop</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        Still don't belive me? Check out the Gallery for some pictures of cute bunnies.
